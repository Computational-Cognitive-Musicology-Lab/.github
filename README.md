# Computational and Cognitive Musicology Lab

In the [Computational and Cognitive Musicology Lab](https://ccml.gtcmt.gatech.edu), we aim to answer questions about musical structure and organization and how people respond to those structures.
We look for new ways to build, organize, distribute, and analyze musical data, while aiming to build user-friendly technologies to assist scholars, educators, and music lovers.
Our research is rooted in the fields of *music cognition* and *computational musicology*, but intersects with *music information retrieval*, *music generation*, *music theory*, and many other applications of music technology.

The CCMLab consists primarily of faculty and students in the Georgia Tech <a href="https://music.gatech.edu">School of Music</a>, and is co-run by Claire Arthur and Nat Condit-Schultz.
Our physical lab space is located on the Georgia Tech campus in Midtown, Atlanta Georgia, in the Couch Building (840 McMillan St NW), room 201.

The CCMLab is part of the Georgia Institute of Technology's [Center for Music Technology](https://gtcmt.gatech.edu/) (GTCMT).
Our sister labs in the GTCMT include the <a href="http://www.musicinformatics.gatech.edu/">Music Informatics Lab</a>, the <a href="https://musicforall.gtcmt.gatech.edu">Computational Music for All Lab</a>, the <a href="https://robotics.gtcmt.gatech.edu">Robotic Musicianship Lab</a>, and the <a href="https://ppl.gtcmt.gatech.edu">Interactive Music, ​
Performance, Audio, ​
and Creative Technologies (IMPACT) lab</a>
